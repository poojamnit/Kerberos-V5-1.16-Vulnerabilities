In Kerberos latest version "krb5-1.16" :- 

Path:-
Kerberos/src/plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principle2.c
At line number:- 893 (refer figure:code reference)

Evidence:-
Refer Figure:dataflow graph 
which is the Graph generated using atlas tool(software analysis framework).
This evidence shows data is flowing to dn container from 5 paths and from
one of the path it is getting NULL value.

Cause:- 
Before calling strlen() function, parameter value was not checked whether it is null or not. In Kerberos, there is a condition when
that parameter value gets null so strlen("NULL") cause segmentation fault and the system can crash.
